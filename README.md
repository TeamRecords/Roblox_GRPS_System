# Robloxian Lightning Empire — GRPS System

**Version:** 1.0 • **Date:** 2025-09-30

The **Group Rank Point System (GRPS)** is a modular promotion, tracking, and automation suite for the **Robloxian Lightning Empire (RLE)**. It aligns real‑world modern & sci‑fi military structures with RLE’s electric‑empire theme. It powers:

- Cross‑experience **points**, **KOs/WOs**, **activity**, and **recommendations** tracking
- A **member UI/GUI** (“NEXUS”) for stats, shouts, leaderboards
- A **Command UI** for search, actions, group edits, and mass operations
- A headless **AutoPromote Bot** that verifies policy and promotes/demotes
- Safe, auditable **API + datastore** with security and rate‑limits

This repository includes **design docs** that Codex (or any code generator/agent) can follow to implement the system in discrete modules while *avoiding binary artifacts*.

> For RLE ranks used by GRPS and the new customized names, see **STRUCTURE.md**.
